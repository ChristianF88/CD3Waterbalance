##Input description for Simulator!!!!!!

'''
Deleter - method delets all .txt - files is the City Drain output folder
Input: Deleter( - path to City Drain output folder - )
Example: Deleter('C:\Users\Acer\Documents\GitHub\CD3Waterbalance\simulationwithpatterns\outputfiles')

runcd3 - method runs City Drain 
Input: runcd3( - path to CityDrain.exe (cd3.exe), path to XML - file that contains model - )
Example: runcd3('C:\Program Files (x86)\CityDrain3\\bin\cd3.exe', C:\Users\Acer\Documents\GitHub\CD3Waterbalance\simulationwithpatterns\outputfiles\Test.xml)
Attention \b in the program path has to be written \\b

Fractioncalculator - method calculates the total area of all Cachtments and the average perv, imperv to stormwaterdrain and imperv to storage area
Input: Fractioncalculator( - the catchmentattributevec that was used for setting up the Test.xml - )
Example: Fractioncalculator([[1,1.9,800,0.4,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.21,1.5,0.4,0.5,400,500,700,0.04,0.05,0.06],[1,1.8,10000,0,1,0,0.6,0.21,1.5,0.4,0.5,380,510,710,0.04,0.05,0.06]])

getoutputdata - method imports all data from the output .txt - files created by City Drain
Input: getoutputdata( - path to City Drain output folder - )
Example: getoutputdata('C:\Users\Acer\Documents\GitHub\CD3Waterbalance\simulationwithpatterns\outputfiles')

getinputdata - method imports rain and evapotranspiration .ixx - files used for the City Drain simulation
Input: getoutputdata( - path to City Drain input folder - )
Example: getoutputdata('C:\Users\Acer\Documents\GitHub\CD3Waterbalance\simulationwithpatterns\inputfiles')

Balance - method checks the models mass balance by comparing input and output data
Input: Balance( - list of all storage output file names, list of filereader/pattern implemeter output file names, list of other neccessary output file names - )
Example: Balance(0.4, 1.5, ['Greywatertanklevels',  'Rainwatertanklevels', 'Stormwaterreservoirlevels'], ['Evapo_Model', 'Rain_Model'], ['Actual_Infiltration', 'Potable_Water_Demand', 'Sewer', 'Stormwaterdrain'])

Plotter - method plots any time series (file) wanted
Input: Plotter( -size (height and width), range of x to plot (in days), range ofy to plot (in m^3), list of file names to plot - )
Example: Plotter([12,10],[0,365], [0,1], ['Rain_Model', 'Stormwaterdrain', 'Evapo_Model', 'effective_rain','Indoor_Demand','Outdoor_Demand'])

Attention!!
The Methods getoutputdata, Balance and Plotter contain file names of the rain and evapotranspiration inputfiles, the rain and evapotr. files given out by the file reader/ pattern implementer and other file names.
Those do have to be adapted to the file names given to the corresponding files! See the methods code for closer description!
