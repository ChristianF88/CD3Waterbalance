## Description 

This Block uses the implemented indoor demand time series and the outdoor demand given by the catchment block to estimate the Water needed by the household as well as the wastewater produced. Furthermore the block distinguishes between potabel and nonpotable water demand as well as between produced grey water and black water.

The individual stream are calculated by simple balances:

- potable water demand consits out of Bathtub, Shower, Tap, Washing Machine, Dishwasher 
- nonpotable water demand is 

|Output Parameter  | Calculation  | 
| :------------ |:---------------:| 
|    Potable Water Demand   | Bathtub + Shower + Tap + Washing Machine + Dishwasher | 
|    Nonpotable Water Demand   |    Toilet + Outdoor Demand     | 
|    Black Water   | Toilet |  
|    Grey Water    |    Bathtub + Shower + Tap + Washing Machine + Dishwasher     |
