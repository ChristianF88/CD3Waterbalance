- potable water demand consist out of Bathtub, Shower, Tap, Washing Machine, Dishwasher 
- non potable water demand is 

|Output Parameter  | Calculation  | 
| :------------ |:---------------:| 
|    Potable Water    | Bathtub + Shower + Tap + Washing Machine + Dishwasher | 
|    Non Potable Water   |    Toilet + Outdoor Demand     |
