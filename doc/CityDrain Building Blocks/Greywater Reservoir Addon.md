# Greywater Reservoir Addon

This Block is set-up the same way as the [Greywater Tank Addon](https://github.com/ChristianF88/CD3Waterbalance/blob/master/doc/CityDrain%20Building%20Blocks/Greywater%20Tank%20Addon.md). 
It's been separated from the Greywater Tanks due to its purpose of being used for several buildings.
The Greywater Reservoirs Overflow will be considered Blackwater.
