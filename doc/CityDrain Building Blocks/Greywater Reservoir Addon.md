# Greywater Reservoir Addon

This Block is set-up the same way as the [Greywater Tank Addon](CD3Waterbalance/doc/CityDrain Building Blocks/Greywater Tank Addon.md). 
It's been separated from the Greywater Tanks due to its purpose of being used for several buildings.
The Greywater Reservoirs Overflow will be considered Blackwater.
