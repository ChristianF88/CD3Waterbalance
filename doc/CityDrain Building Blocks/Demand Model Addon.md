# Demand Model

Basic features:

 - 2 calculation modes, a simple model with constant average flows and a complex stochastic model
 - creates a flow for different indoor uses separately

## Description 

### Stochatic Model

The [stochastic demand model]() used produces, every time it is being run, diurnal demand - vectors, with a hourly time step, for each Unit in a building.
The programmed City Drain 3 (CD3) addon block sums up all those vectors (for each use seperately), so that there's eight vector for a building.
(_bathtub vector, shower vector, kitchen tap vector, handbasin tap vector, evapcooler vector, toilet vector, dishwasher vector, washing machine vector_)
The by the stochastic demand model produced added up vector have the following shape:

demand model run n: 
vector n = [demand 12 pm [l/h], demand 1 am [l/h], demand 2 am [l/h], ..., demand 11 pm [l/h]]

demand model run n+1: 
vector n+1 = [demand 12 pm [l/h], demand 1 am [l/h], demand 2 am [l/h], ..., demand 11 pm [l/h]]

A demand vector used for the calculations in CD3 consists out of two vectors given out by the stochastic model:

vector - day n = [demand 1 am [l/h] (vector n), demand 2 am [l/h] (vector n), ..., demand 11 pm [l/h] (vector n), demand 12 pm [l/h] (vector n+1)]


Depending on the simulations time step the vectors time increment is being modified.
Is the time step smaller than one hour a random event during that hour is being created.

# 

| Simulations Time Step [h] | CD3 - Calculation of Demand | 
| :------------: |:---------------:| 
| < 1     | an event is being created, randomly for some time during the hour  |
| 	1  | vector doesn't need to be modified  |
| 	24  | all digits within the vector are being added up |
| 	n (n < 24)  | n digits within the vector are being added up  |

### Simple Model

Average values for the different indoor demand streams will be used for the calculation.
To change the pre-set values the Demand Model Block must be adjusted. Values must be given in litre per day and capita.
The following values were taken from the [Yarra Valley Water Report](https://www.yvw.com.au/yvw/groups/public/documents/document/yvw1003236.pdf) and a ratio describing the breakdown of handbasin tap and kitchen tap 
was taken from [Perth Residential Water Use Study](http://www.water.wa.gov.au/PublicationStore/first/98576.pdf):


| Flow / Ratio | Unit |  Value |
| :------------: |:---------------:| :---------------:| 
| Ratio Handbasin Tap to Handbasin plus Kitchen Tap | [-] | 2.5 / (3 + 2.5)| 
| Bathtub | [L/(d*cap)] | 2 | 
| Shower | [L/(d*cap)] | 34 | 
| Toilet | [L/(d*cap)] | 19 | 
| Kitchen Tap | [L/(d*cap)] | 21 * (1-Ratio) | 
| Handbasin Tap | [L/(d*cap)] | 21 * Ratio | 
| Washing Machine | [L/(d*cap)] | 22 | 
| Dishwasher | [L/(d*cap)] | 1 | 
| Evapcooler | [L/(d*cap)] | 0 | 

# 

Residential units in a building may use any od the flows above except of the Evapcooler, whereas commercial units dont use Bathtubs and Washing Machines.

## Recommended Improvements

- fill up evapcooler use
- make the constant values of the simple model changeable from citydrain.
