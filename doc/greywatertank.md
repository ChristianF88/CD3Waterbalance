## Description 

This module collects Greywater. The stored volume depends on the yield of treatment specified. 1 - yield of treatment gives the part of Greywater that is equivalent to the Wastewater produced by the treatment process. If the tanks/reservoirs specified volume is exceeded inflowing water is given to the Greywater Overflow, thereby being added to the Sewer.
